# <Password Generator>

---

## Description

My motivation to fix this code was to utilize the geneator for future purposes as it is actually handy. I built this project because it could solve the problem of having to come up with a unique password when it comes time to change my password to an account. I learned that drying out a code, is not necessarily breaking the code!
